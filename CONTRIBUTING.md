## 🚀 Quick Start for Contributors

**Fork and clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/canner.git
cd canner
```

### Building up Backend

1. **Set up the development environment:**

   ```bash
   - Using Dev Containers
     Press F1 then: Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Containers


   cd backend && python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt && python app.py
   ```

### Building up Frontend

```bash
cd browser-extension

# Install dependencies
sudo npm install

# Build for production
sudo npm run build

```

This creates a `dist/` folder with the compiled extension files:

```
dist/
├── background.js        # Background service worker
├── content.js          # Content script for LinkedIn
├── content.css         # Styles for injected UI
├── popup.html          # Extension popup interface
├── popup.js            # Popup React app
├── manifest.json       # Extension manifest
└── icons/              # Extension icons
    ├── icon16.png
    ├── icon32.png
    ├── icon48.png
    └── icon128.png
```

### Load Extension in Chrome

1. **Open Chrome Extensions page:**

   ```
   chrome://extensions/
   ```

2. **Enable Developer Mode:**

   - Toggle the "Developer mode" switch in the top-right corner

3. **Load the Extension:**

   - Click "Load unpacked" button
   - Navigate to and select the `browser-extension/dist/` folder
   - Click "Select Folder"

4. **Verify Installation:**
   - Extension should appear in the extensions list
   - Look for "Canner" with version 1.0.0
   - Pin the extension to toolbar for easy access

### Load Extension in Firefox

1. **Open Firefox Add-ons Debug page:**

   ```
   about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox
   ```

2. **Load Temporary Add-on:**

   - Click "Load Temporary Add-on" button
   - Navigate to `browser-extension/dist/` folder
   - Select the `manifest.json` file
   - Click "Open"

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Extension should appear in the temporary extensions list
   - Check the browser toolbar for the extension icon


### Access pgAdmin & Configure Database

After building the frontend, you can access the database management interface:

1. **Open pgAdmin in Browser:**
   
   Navigate to: **http://localhost:8080**

2. **Login to pgAdmin:**
   
   - **Email:** `admin@canner.dev`
   - **Password:** `admin123`

3. **Register PostgreSQL Server:**
   
   a. Right-click **"Servers"** in the left sidebar
   
   b. Select **"Register" → "Server"**
   
   c. **General Tab:**
      - Name: `Canner Dev` (or any name you prefer)
   
   d. **Connection Tab:**
      - Host name/address: `postgres` ⚠️ **Important:** Use `postgres` (container name), not `localhost`
      - Port: `5432`
      - Maintenance database: `canner_dev`
      - Username: `developer`
      - Password: `devpassword`
      - ☑️ Check "Save password" (optional, for convenience)
   
   e. Click **"Save"**

4. **Browse the Database:**
   
   Once connected, expand the tree structure:
   ```
   Servers
     └─ Canner Dev
         └─ Databases
             └─ canner_dev
                 └─ Schemas
                     └─ public
                         └─ Tables
                             └─ responses
   ```

5. **Common Database Tasks:**
   
   - **View table data:** Right-click on `responses` → "View/Edit Data" → "All Rows"
   - **Run SQL queries:** Right-click on `canner_dev` → "Query Tool"
   - **Check table structure:** Expand `responses` → Click "Columns"

> **Tip:** If you can't connect, wait 10-20 seconds for PostgreSQL to fully initialize, then try again.

### Check Tables Using psql (Command Line)

Alternatively, you can use the PostgreSQL command-line tool to inspect the database:

1. **Connect to PostgreSQL:**
   
   ```bash
   # From inside the dev container or backend container
   psql -h postgres -U developer -d canner_dev
   
   # From your host machine
   psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U developer -d canner_dev
   ```
   
   When prompted, enter password: `devpassword`

2. **Useful psql Commands:**
   
   ```sql
   -- List all databases
   \l
   
   -- Connect to canner_dev database (if not already connected)
   \c canner_dev
   
   -- List all tables
   \dt
   
   -- Describe the responses table structure
   \d responses
   
   -- View all data in responses table
   SELECT * FROM responses;
   
   -- Count total responses
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM responses;
   
   -- View recent responses (last 10)
   SELECT id, title, created_at FROM responses ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
   
   -- Search responses by title
   SELECT * FROM responses WHERE title LIKE '%example%';
   
   -- Exit psql
   \q
   ```

3. **Quick Database Health Check:**
   
   ```bash
   # Test database connection (one-liner)
   psql -h postgres -U developer -d canner_dev -c "SELECT COUNT(*) as total_responses FROM responses;"
   
   # View database version
   psql -h postgres -U developer -d canner_dev -c "SELECT version();"
   
   # Check if table exists
   psql -h postgres -U developer -d canner_dev -c "\dt responses"
   ```
